A try at an immersive VI-like editor

Introduction
------------

This is a *try* to create a **python** based *immersive* editor with **VI**
like editing functions.

Features
--------

It should be immersive, so it should clear all distractions if possible. For
that to happen, it should have some certain *features*:

- fullscreen -- It should go directly in fullscreen mode, or maximized,
  otherwise.
- uncluttered -- The **GUI** elements, if any, should be small or initially
  invisible.

Dependencies
------------

- python -- Of course, this is the first and primary dependency.
- sdl -- We'll use **SDL** to easily switch to fullscreen and for different
  effects, and graphical things.
